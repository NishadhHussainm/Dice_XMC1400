# Digital Dice Simulator

## Overview

The Digital Dice Simulator is a project based on a microcontroller that imitates the rolling of a dice using 4 LEDs to show the outcome. This project serves a purpose. Aims to provide an enjoyable introduction, to microcontroller programming.



## Components

 Microcontroller (e.g., XMC1400)
 4 LEDs
 Power Supply

## Setup

1. **Configuring the Microcontroller;**
Connect the microcontroller to your development environment.
Set up GPIO pins for the 4 LEDs.

2. **Generating Random Numbers;**
Implement an algorithm in the code for generating numbers.

3. **Displaying LEDs;**
Code that displays the generated number on the 4 LEDs.

## Usage

 **Rolling the Dice;**
The result of each simulated dice roll will be displayed by the LEDs.


## Testing

 Ensure that the LEDs accurately display the numbers.
 Verify that random number generation is functioning correctly.## Optional Improvements

 Incorporate some effects.
 Explore different LED patterns to enhance the display.
 Implement power saving modes to extend battery life.
